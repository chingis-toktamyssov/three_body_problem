# 3-Body Problem Simulation

This project is a **real-time 3-body problem simulator** using **C++**, **OpenGL**, and **GLM**. It simulates how three particles move under mutual gravitational attraction, showing a chaotic system.

## Features

- RK4 physics solver for stable integration
- Real-time rendering with OpenGL
- Colored particles with trails to visualize their paths
- Camera controls to pan, zoom, and explore off-screen trajectories
- Configurable trail length and simulation speed
